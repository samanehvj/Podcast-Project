      Candace and Jess meet in the podcast basement bi-weekly to take turns judging a book by its cover. They do not read the books, but rather tell you the story they see hidden within the cover art. Each episode features one book, lots of laughs, friendly banter, and probably a few song suggestions along the way. If you're looking for a light hearted comedy podcast, that makes you feel like you're hanging out with your best buds then look no further. New episodes every other Thursday!
